# Learning NoSQL databases: MongoDB & Neo4j

## Overview
I wanted to get some hands-on practice with NoSQL databases, so I tried both **MongoDB** and **Neo4j**. The focus was on learning how to model and query data in different ways – document-based (MongoDB) and graph-based (Neo4j).

This is an exploration to see how the two technologies work, compare their strengths, and get comfortable writing queries.

## Repository Structure
- `data/` – Sample datasets used for the exercises.  
- `mongodb/` – My MongoDB work (Jupyter Notebook + short write-up in PDF).  
- `neo4j/` – My Neo4j work (Notebook, PDF, and property graph model).  

## Technologies Used
- MongoDB  
- Neo4j  
- Python / Jupyter Notebook
